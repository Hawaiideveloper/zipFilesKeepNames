# Get those files under control


## Create a systematic java function that will zip each file with a certain extension





#### The plan is to create a zip file for each original file

- [ ] 1.) Create a directory  
- [ ] 2.) Create a compressed file for each file with the extension  
- [ ] 3.) Ensure the newly created compressed file maintains the original file name  
- [ ] 4.) Move the original file into a directory so stakeholders can not complain about   integrity
